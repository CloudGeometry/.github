# CloudGeometry
[CloudGeometry](https://cloudgeometry.io/) is a hands-on, technical services consultancy and cloud platform integrator. We work with our clients to design, build, implement, and operate full stack cloud solutions. Our clients rely on us to address their business and platform infrastructure challenges. We deliver  on their business critical needs by combining components from open source cloud native technologies and cloud service provider offerings.

Each engagement is as unique as the business problems it targets. Because our expert teams work with these common components again and again, we can quickly assemble and adapt well-engineered toolchains and architectures that work well with your systems.

The solutions we develop for our clients are curated from the portfolio of open source projects[^oss_management]. cataloged here. Where appropriate, we publish the learnings from our engagements to give back to the open source communities from which they were drawn. This includes templates, code snippets, tools, and in many cases, contributions of fresh code to the Upstream open source project where they came from.
